	<!-<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a way to represent the efficiency of an algorithm. It's important to choose an efficient algorithm.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input data. <b>Space Complexity</b> can be represented as O(n).</p>- the entire body must be written by student -->
