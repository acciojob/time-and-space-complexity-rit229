	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a concept that helps us analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It is important to choose an efficient algorithm for better performance.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input data. <b>Space Complexity</b> can be expressed as O(n).</p>
